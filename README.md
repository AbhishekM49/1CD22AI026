## 📌 Module Overview

### AlexNet (CNN)
Implements the classic **AlexNet architecture** for image classification using TensorFlow/Keras.  
Demonstrates deep CNN design, pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.

---

### Cat vs Dog Classification
Builds a CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs using **TensorFlow’s built-in dataset** (`cats_vs_dogs`).  
No manual dataset download is required.

---

### Deep Reinforcement Learning
Implements **Q-Learning** to find the optimal path in a graph-based environment using a reward matrix and Q-table.

---

### LSTM – Time Series Forecasting
Uses **LSTM networks** to learn and predict sequential time-series data such as airline passenger counts.

---

### RNN / LSTM – Text Generation
Generates text at the **character level** using recurrent neural networks.  
Learns patterns from a given sentence and produces new sequences.

---

### Tic Tac Toe using Reinforcement Learning
A self-learning Tic Tac Toe game where an AI agent learns optimal strategies through **self-play and reward feedback**, without hard-coded rules.
